Yesterday I wrote about localizing the Products API with OpenAPI overlays , treating the whole API description as one document to be translated four ways. Today I want to go down a level, because the more interesting structural decision in that little Products API template isn’t the OpenAPI at all — it’s that the data models don’t actually live inside the OpenAPI. They live next to it, as standalone JSON Schema files, and that single choice is what makes everything else flexible.
